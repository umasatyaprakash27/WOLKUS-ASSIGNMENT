# WOLKUS-ASSIGNMENT
Here initially i have created a movie ott platform sort of webpage using java script, CSS and HTML. 
And then i have created a login page and connected the ott webpage which was created intially with the login page which made simpler.
I have created playlists as new releases in the web page.
I have named the webpage as FLAKES which will be displayed inside the webpage as a brand name.
I have made the website in two themes Light and dark mode for the user convenience.
Link for the webpage without the login page: https://umasatyaprakash27.github.io/wolkuswebpage/
# You can access my final webpage by running login.html file.
I'm unable to publish my final webpage online which included login page so please run my login.html file to get access into the final one which includes all the required parameters.
# The credentials for the Login page are
USERNAME: username
PASSWORD: password
